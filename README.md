This set of scripts can be used to check the Kubernetes installation against the best-practices. They are inspired by CIS Kubernetes 1.6 Benchmark.

These scripts are devided into the set to run on the Kubernetes master nodes and the set to run on the worker nodes.

On the master nodes,
```
$ ./master.sh
```

On the worker nodes,
```
$ ./worker.sh
```
